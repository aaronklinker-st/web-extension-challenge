# Web Extension Challenge

This project is completely blank. Why? Because you're going to be creating a web extension from scratch. You can choose everything about building the project. Will it be 100% vanilla JS? Will you use a build tool or bundler? Everything is up to you.

So, what are the features of the extension we're building? The extension track the user's "fish history":

### Requirements

- [ ] Save every URL whose page includes the word "fish", along with the time it was seen at
- [ ] Create a UI that shows the users "fish history"
- [ ] Allow the user to delete fish history entries from the UI
- [ ] Since the user's fish history might be quite long, make sure to paginate the list displayed on the UI
- [ ] Allow the user to setup a blocklist of domains where fish history should not be tracked
- [ ] It must work on both Chrome and Firefox

### Key Take Aways

After finishing your extension, you should be able to answer the following questions:

1. How are web extensions structured?
2. How can you run code against a webpage?
3. How do permissions effect the APIs available at runtime?
4. What options are available for storing data in an extension, and when should each be used?
5. How does communication work between different parts of a web extension?
